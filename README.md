# ReproduceMeGit

ReproduceMeGit is a visualization tool for analyzing the reproducibility of Jupyter Notebooks. This will help repository users and owners to reproduce and directly analyze and assess the reproducibility of any GitHub repository containing Jupyter Notebooks. The tool provides information on the number of notebooks that were successfully reproducible, those that resulted in exceptions, those with different results from the original notebooks, etc. Each notebook in the repository along with the provenance information of its execution can also be exported in RDF with the integration of the [ProvBook](https://github.com/Sheeba-Samuel/provenancebook) tool.
